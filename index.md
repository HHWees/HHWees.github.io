**About me**

Hi there! I am a Fulbright Scholar and a second-year graduate student in Diagnostic Genetics and Genomics at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. My thesis research, under the guidance of Dr. Wenyi Wang, focuses on developing benchmark-informed deconvolution method to uncover immune heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment.

I hold a B.S. in Biotechnology and have completed clinical rotations in MD Anderson‚Äôs Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, where I gained hands-on experience in molecular diagnostics workflows and bioinformatics analysis.

My research interests lie at the intersection of bioinformatics and cancer biology. I have expertise in Python, R, and Bash scripting, and I am currently developing my computational skills in machine learning.

Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking, reading, baking üç∞, and playing video games üéÆ
