**About me**

Hi there, I am a Fulbright Scholar and second‑year graduate student in Diagnostic Genetics and Genomics at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. I'm currently conducting My thesis under the guidance of Dr. Wenyi Wang, focuses on developing benchmark‑informed deconvolution method to reveal immune heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment. I hold a B.S. in Biotechnology and completed clinical rotations across MD Anderson’s Molecular Diagnostic Lab, gaining hands‑on experience across molecular diagnostics workflows and bioinformatics analysis.

My research interests span bioinformatics and cancer biology. My expertise includes programming in in Python, R, and bash scripting.

Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking, reading, baking, and playing video games
